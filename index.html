            I'm staying tired<br>
            The so-called technology<br>
            Just talk by e-mail<br>
            Short and cold Message<br>
            Twitter and Facebook<br>
            Before I expire<br>
            I will say all in poetry.

            Nothing is like was before<br>
            Is all abbreviated<br>
            "You" just have two letters<br>
            The "O" and the "E" was crossed<br>
            For declared  the love<br>
            That's enough some flower<br>
            And some drew heart.

            The emoticom is a risk<br>
            Has symbols for everything<br>
            Point and comma and asterisk<br>

            I miss my letters<br>
            Wrote with by own hands<br>
            Sent on June month<br>
            Just arrive on summer<br>
            But old time's sake<br>
            Was a true text<br>
            In the heart lines

            Now, I write and send <br>
            Arriving at the same time <br>
            But when I go to read<br>
            The person gone <br>
            Open other app <br>
            The world became captive<br>
            The technology of now.

            Happily, to pray<br>
            Not need the internet<br>
            God heard everyone<br>
            If you want, do this text<br>
            Two points are two knees<br>
            Your lips are device<br>
            Leave that God interpret.
